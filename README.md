# Sunny-Land

## Introduction

Sunny Land is a mini horizontal Parkour game implemented with Unity. In this game, the player plays a little fox to explore the forest, pick up items and beat enemies.

This is my first game. I developed this game independently under [a series of online tutorials](https://space.bilibili.com/370283072/channel/collectiondetail?sid=2991) for the selection exam of the international summer school organized by the University of Bologna in 2020.
